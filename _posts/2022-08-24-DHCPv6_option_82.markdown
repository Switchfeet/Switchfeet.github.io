[RFC 8415](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8415.html) has defined the DHCPv6 SOL_MAX_RT option, and option-code is 82.

When doing DHCPv6 handshake, if a client includes an Option Request option (ORO) to request the SOL_MAX_RT option and gets a valid SOL_MAX_RT option from the server, this value of SOL_MAX_RT will replace the default value of the client.

One use for the SOL_MAX_RT option is to set a higher value for SOL_MAX_RT; this reduces the Solicit traffic from a client that has not received a response to its Solicit messages.

If a client sends a solicit message and fails to get a response from the server after some time due to router power failure or outage, the client will retransmit the solicit message after a backoff timer expired. And the next retransmission time of solicit message will be calculated depending on the previous one until it reaches the value of SOL_MAX_RT.
